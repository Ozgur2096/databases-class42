1.  - Column food_code and food_description violate 1NF because they contain multiple values separated by commas (not atomic).
    - Column dinner_date violates 1NF because in each column the values stored must be of the same kind or type.

2.  These entities can be extracted:
        Members (member_id, member_name, member_address)
        Dinners (dinner_id, dinner_date, venue_code)
        Venues (venue_code, venue_description)
        Foods (food_code, food_description)

3.  3NF solution: 
        Members Table         (member_id (PK), member_name, member_address)
        Dinners Table         (dinner_id (PK), dinner_date, venue_code(FK))
        Venues Table          (venue_code (PK), venue_description)
        Foods Table           (food_code (PK), food_description)
        Members_diners Table  (id (PK), member_id (FK), dinner_id (FK))
        Dinners_food Table    (id (PK), dinner_id (FK), food_code (FK))
